          Load the sample program to populate memory addresses required for the
          interrupt handler (1001â€“1003).
        </p>
        <p>
          Triggered interrupts are queued during the fetch phase and processed
          sequentially to preserve program flow.

        <p>
          Execution logs persist until you reset the simulation. Use the
          download button in the IAS tab to archive them.
